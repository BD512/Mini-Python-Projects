## Mastermind
#### Based on the classic mastermind game.
#### Instructions for playing:
1. Guess a 4 digit number with any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (the digits can be used twice).
2. You will then be told how many digits you got which were both the correct number and placed correctly and the correct numbers but placed wrongly.
3. From using this information, you can guess again.
4. Keep guessing until you get the correct number and try to get it in the fewest possible tries.

#### Please note:
1. When run, the "mastermind2.py" should show the text as different colours/ thicknesses in the python console. If it does not, it will be due to your interprater not recognising the colour escape codes and these escape codes may appear as part of the text printed.
